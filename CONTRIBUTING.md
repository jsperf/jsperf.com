# Contributing to JSPerf
## Submitting a Pull Request

* Make all changes in a *new* branch of `master`, e.g., `feature/new-logo`
* Follow all coding rules below
* Ensure all tests are passing (`npm test`)
* In GitHub send a pull request to "jsperf:master"
* If we suggest changes, always re-run tests after completing those changes
* Rebase feature branches as needed (do not merge)

## Coding Rules

These guidelines help keep the codebase consistent.
* All features or bugs must be tested
* Code coverage shall remain at 100% after any new feature or bug fix
* Code should pass ESLint which follows the [semistandard style](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard)
