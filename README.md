## How to run a local copy of jsPerf

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (see preferred version in [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/jsperf/jsperf.com/blob/master/.nvmrc))
2. [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
  1. Install
    1. macOS: `brew install mysql`
  2. Initialize: `mysql -uroot -e "CREATE DATABASE jsperf; GRANT ALL ON jsperf.* TO 'jsuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'jspass'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"`
3. Get a [Browserscope.org](https://www.browserscope.org/) API key by signing in and going to [the settings page](https://www.browserscope.org/user/settings).
4. Register a [new OAuth GitHub application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). Leave the callback URL blank. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret".

### Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file (will be ignored by git) with the following variables (`VAR_NAME=value`):

```
NODE_ENV=development
# from Prerequisites step 2.2
MYSQL_USER=jsuser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=jspass
MYSQL_DATABASE=jsperf
# from Prerequisites step 3
BROWSERSCOPE=
# from Prerequisites step 4
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CALLBACK=http://localhost:3000

BELL_COOKIE_PASS=password-should-be-32-characters
COOKIE_PASS=password-should-be-32-characters

# customizable but not recommended for local development
# SCHEME=http
# DOMAIN=localhost
# PORT=3000
# MYSQL_HOST=localhost
# MYSQL_PORT=3306
# LOGGLY_TOKEN=
# LOGGLY_SUBDOMAIN=
# REDIS_HOST=
